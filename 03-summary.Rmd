# Final Words

This template contains several files with different extensions and may look daunting at first. However, unless you want to customise specific aspects of this template, you *only* need to edit/add individual R Markdown files corresponding to each chapter of your course notes. Nevertheless, here's a brief description of each file in this template stratified by type.

## What are all these files for?

### Markdown files {-}

+ `index.Rmd`: The *only* non-optional file. 
  
  1. Starts with a YAML configuration file to set the title, author, date and other build options.
  
  ````YAML
  --- 
  title: |
    ![](standard-vertical-black.png){width=0.4in} MTXXXX: Some stats
  description: "This is an example gitbook with some St Andrews styling."
  author: "[L. Scott-Hayward](lass@st-andrews.ac.uk) and [JJ Valletta](jjv1@st-andrews.ac.uk)"
  date: '`r format(Sys.Date(), "%d %B %Y")`'
  site: bookdown::bookdown_site
  documentclass: book
  bibliography: [book.bib, packages.bib]
  biblio-style: apalike
  link-citations: yes
  colorlinks: yes
  ---
  ````
  
  2. Sets the global `knitr` options. These options can be overridden at the start of each chapter if one wants each chapter to have its own default options.
  ````
  ``{r setup, echo=FALSE}
  library(knitr)
  ## set knitr global options
  opts_chunk$set(cache=F, tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=55), tidy=F, 
                 fig.align="center", fig.width=5, fig.height=5,
                 multCode=F, renderTask=T, renderSol=T)
  ``
  ````
  
  3. Add `_setup.Rmd` to the book.
  ````
  ``{r, child = "_setup.Rmd", include = F, purl = F, cache = F}
  ``
  ````
  
  4. Normal R Markdown. Typically contains the preface of your course notes, as shown in the template. 
  Although it can be written as a separate `.Rmd` file for more modularity.
  
  ````
  # Welcome {-}

  Welcome to MTXXXX: Some stats!
  ...
  ````
  
  5. The last chunk of code in `index.Rmd` creates a BibTeX file to reference the packages used, see `packages.bib` for more details. This is optional.    
  
+ `_setup.Rmd`: This file specifies features/environments exclusive to this template; the task/solution block, multi-tabbed solutions, etc (see Chapter \@ref(bellsandwhistles)).
Do not edit this file!

+ `01-intro.Rmd` - `03-summary.Rmd`: These files contain all the content of your course notes. Each `.Rmd` file is a chapter and must begin with a single `#` level header (e.g. `# Linear regression`). You can have as many files as you want. `.Rmd` files are added to the book in alphabetical order. It is therefore recommended to number the files in the order you'd like them to appear. Alternatively, use `_bookdown.yml` to specify the precise order (more on that later).  

+ `04-references.Rmd`: Appends references at the end of the gitbook/HTML book. You can edit the name of the file, but don't edit what's in it. 

+ `05-ch_appendix.Rmd`: Appends solutions at the end of the PDF file. You can edit the name of the file, but don't edit what's in it. 

+ `README.md`: Primarily intended as a landing page for the [Github repo](https://github.com/lindesaysh/StAndrewsTemplateBookdown) where this template is currently residing. This file can be safely deleted. Alternatively, if you don't use version control (like git), this file can be used to keep track of any major changes done to your course notes.

### YAML files {-}

[YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) files are human-readable files typically used for configuration files.

+ `_bookdown.yml`: Overarching configuration file for the book; set book file name, output directory, etc. It allows you to choose which chapters to include under which build (gitbook/html or pdf/latex). This is particularly useful when you're working on a large number of chapters. Through the `rmd_files` option you can choose to only compile the chapter you're currently working on, which reduces compilation time significantly.  

**Note**: The `latex` option must have the `appendix.Rmd` file as its last entry (name of file is irrelevant). This ensures that the appendix is properly formatted for the solutions to the problems. This is *only* needed for the PDF output; for gitbook/HTML, the task/solution block uses a toggle button instead.

```YAML
book_filename: "StAndrewsTemplate"
language:
  ui:
    chapter_name: "Chapter "
delete_merged_file: true
rmd_files:
  html: ["index.Rmd", "01-intro.Rmd", "02-bellsandwhistles.Rmd", "03-summary.Rmd", "04-references.Rmd"]
  latex: ["index.Rmd", "01-intro.Rmd", "02-bellsandwhistles.Rmd", "03-summary.Rmd",  "04-references.Rmd", "05-ch_appendix.Rmd"]
output_dir: "docs"
```

+ `_output.yml`: Configuration file to set individual options of *each* output format. For example, which TeX typesetting engine to use, which style sheet to use for gitbook/HTML, whether to split the book by chapter or sections, etc. This information can be alternatively included in the YAML portion of `index.Rmd` (under the `output:` option). However, by having it as a separate file, it makes `index.Rmd` less cluttered. No need to edit this file unless you really want to.

```YAML
bookdown::gitbook:
  lib_dir: "book_assets"
  config:
    sharing: null
    edit: null
    download: ["pdf"]
  split_by: chapter
  highlight: pygments
  css: 'style.css'
  includes:
    in_header: '_toggle.html'
    
bookdown::pdf_book:
  keep_tex: TRUE
  citation_package: natbib
  latex_engine: xelatex
  includes:
    in_header: preamble.tex
    after_body: afterbody.tex
```


### LaTeX files {-}

+ `preamble.tex`: LaTeX preamble; load packages, define new commands, etc. It also defines the task/solution boxes for the PDF.

+ `afterbody.tex`: This file specifies what to include at the *end* of the PDF. Currently it simply calls `\printindex` to generate a linked index.
You can add words to the index using the `\index{}` command, e.g. `\index{least-squares}`. 


### Bibliography files {-}

+ `book.bib`: BibTeX file with your references. This file can be generated by most reference management software like [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/), [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/), etc.    

+ `packages.bib`: This BibTeX file is created from the last chunk of code in `index.Rmd` file.  It compiles the citations of the specified packages. 

````

``{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown', 'ggplot2'
), 'packages.bib')
``

````

### Web files {-}

+ `style.css`: CSS files describe the "look" of a webpage (colours, font sizes, etc.). Here, it describes the styling of the gitbook and includes the style of the task/solution blocks, the colour of the figure captions etc. The St Andrews colours used can be found [here](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/brand/design-guidelines/colours/). Edit at your own risk!

+ `toggle.html`. This is a javascript file for rendering the show/hide solution toggle button. Do not edit.


### Hidden files {-}

+ `.gitignore`/`.gitattributes`: Ignore/delete unless you use git for version control.

## Publish book on Moodle

Once you have finished compiling your course notes into a nice book, it is time to share it with your students on Moodle by following these steps:

1. Compress the folder containing the compiled course notes as a `.zip` file
^[The name of this folder is set in `output_dir` in `_bookdown.yml`, e.g. `docs`]. 
If you do not use version control, it is recommended that you rename this zip file by adding a timestamp (e.g. `docs_20200721.zip`), in case you want to archive older versions.

2. Log into your course page on Moodle and turn editing on.

3. Navigate to the section/topic where you want to upload the course notes and press "+ Add an activity or resource". 
Select "File" rather than "Folder" and upload the `.zip` file.

4. Click on the zipped file and select "unzip".

5. Click on the unzipped folder, select `index.html` and "Set main file".

6. Save and return to course.
