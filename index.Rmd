# Welcome {-}

Welcome to MTXXXX: Some stats!

An introductory-course in the field of statistical modelling in R. The focus will be on how to fit statistical models in R. The target audience is anyone who wants to learn how to fit linear models in R. The progression will be linear models, generalised linear models and linear mixed effects models.

## Prerequisites {-}

* Programming basics in R
* MTXXXX

## Learning outcomes {-}

* Understand the key concepts and terminology used in statistical modelling
* Use R to fit linear, generalised linear and mixed effect models in R
* Recognise practical issues with fitting these models
* Checking model fit
* Perform model comparisons

## Recommended reading {-}

I highly recommend the following books:

* [Statistics: An Introduction using R](https://www.wiley.com/en-gb/Statistics%3A+An+Introduction+using+R-p-9780470022986)
* [Linear models with R](https://www.crcpress.com/Linear-Models-with-R/Faraway/p/book/9781439887332)


## Data files {-}

All data files can be found on Moodle. 

## Assessment {-}

80% written exam and 20% **individual** coursework

## Lateness policy {-}

The School has a lateness [policy](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/maths/current/ug/information/latepenalties/). The standard policy is an  initial penalty of 15% of the maximum available mark, then a further 5% per 8-hour period, or part thereof for work submitted late without good reason.

## Work submitted late for good reason {-}

If students have a justified reason for submitting work late, then the various University's policies relating to extenuating circumstances apply.  In these circumstances, students must as soon as possible submit a self-certificate of absence and contact the relevant member of School (usually the module coordinator).  You will then be advised whether further documentation is required and what format this documentation will take.
