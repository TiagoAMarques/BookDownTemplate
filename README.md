# St Andrews bookdown template

A template for St Andrews course notes using the [`bookdown`](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/) package. 
Big thanks to [TJ McKinley](https://github.com/tjmckinley/RtutorialSkeleton) for sharing with us the core of this template. 

You can download or clone the repository and then compile the project. This can be done on any operating system by opening the "StAndrewsTemplateBookdown.Rproj" project in RStudio. The "Build Book" button in the "Build" pane can be used to compile the book.

After the build is complete, all necessary files will be included in the docs folder which is made as part of the build. After compilation, open the file `index.html` to see examples on how to use the template.
